# COVID-19-DATA-ANALYSIS
## Data Science & Analytics Internship Project – Tamizhan Skills

## Introduction
This project, COVID-19 Data Analysis, is developed as part of the Data Science and Analytics Internship at Tamizhan Skills. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant global impact, making data-driven analysis essential for understanding infection trends, recovery rates, and mortality patterns. This project focuses on analyzing global COVID-19 data to visualize the spread of the pandemic and compare trends across countries.

Using Python-based data analytics and visualization techniques, this project converts large-scale pandemic data into meaningful visual insights that support public health planning and awareness.

## Problem Statement
Understanding COVID-19 trends is critical for governments and healthcare institutions to plan effective public health policies. Without proper visualization and analysis, it becomes difficult to assess the severity of outbreaks, recovery progress, and death rates across different regions.

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are to:

- Analyze global COVID-19 confirmed, recovered, and death cases
- Track cumulative growth of the pandemic over time
- Compare COVID-19 trends among top affected countries
- Visualize data using line plots, area charts, and heatmaps
- Present a clear visual story of the pandemic’s progression

This project supports the Tamizhan Skills internship objective of applying data science techniques to real-world global issues.

## Dataset Description
The dataset (full_grouped.csv) contains daily COVID-19 statistics for multiple countries, including:

- Date
- Country/Region
- Confirmed Cases
- Deaths
- Recovered Cases
- Active Cases

Missing values are handled, and duplicate records are removed to ensure clean and reliable analysis.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas – Data cleaning and aggregation
- Matplotlib – Line plots and area charts
- Seaborn – Heatmap visualization
- Time-Series Data Analysis

## Methodology
The workflow implemented in the program code includes:

1. Loading COVID-19 data with date parsing

2. Cleaning data by handling missing values and duplicates

3. Aggregating data by date and country

4. Identifying top 5 most affected countries based on confirmed cases

5. Plotting line charts for confirmed, recovered, and death trends

6. Creating area charts to show cumulative case growth

7. Generating heatmaps to compare confirmed cases across countries and dates

8. Performing grouped analysis for regional insights
